guidelines = """Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes.
    Take a few deep breaths to help you relax.
    Picture a setting that is calm and peaceful.
    This could be a beach, a mountain setting, a meadow, or a scene that you choose.
    
    Add some detail to your scene.. For example, is there a breeze? How does it feel? What do you smell? What does 
    the sky look like? Is it clear, or are there clouds? It often helps to add a path to your scene. For example, 
    as you enter the meadow, imagine a path leading you through the meadow to the trees on the other side. As you 
    follow the path farther into the meadow, you feel more and more relaxed. Take a few minutes to breathe slowly and 
    feel the calm. This is best done when you are deep into your scene and are feeling relaxed.
    
    Think of a "return" cue.
    Think of a simple word or sound that you can use in the future to help you return to this place.
    
    Exit from your scene. When you are ready, slowly take yourself out of the scene and back to the present. Tell 
    yourself that you will feel relaxed and refreshed and will bring your sense of calm with you.
    
    Count to 3, and open your eyes.
