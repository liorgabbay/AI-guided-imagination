Lior, I'm so glad you're taking the first step towards seeking help and healing. Before we begin, I want to let you know that this guided imagery is a safe and gentle way to explore your emotions and thoughts, and it's completely okay to stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed. You're in control, and I'm here to support you. If you need to pause or take a break, just let me know, and we can resume whenever you're ready.

As we start, I want to remind you that you're not alone, and it's incredible that you're taking the time to prioritize your well-being. Please make yourself as comfortable as possible, and take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth.

Imagine yourself standing in a peaceful place, a space where you feel completely safe and relaxed. This could be a beautiful beach, a serene forest, or a cozy meadow. Take a moment to immerse yourself in the sights, sounds, and smells of this place. Notice the sensations in your body, and allow yourself to feel the peace and tranquility of this environment.

As you walk through this peaceful place, imagine a gentle stream running nearby. The sound of the water is soothing, and the gentle flow of the stream is calming. Allow yourself to breathe in the fresh air, and feel the stress and tension melting away.

Lior, I want to gently bring to your attention the experiences you've had during your time in the army. I'm not asking you to relive them, but rather to acknowledge the emotions and memories that still linger. Remember that you're in control, and we can take this at your own pace. Allow yourself to process your feelings, and remember that you're not alone.

As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine a healing light beginning to shine down on you. This light can be any color that feels soothing to you. As it touches your head, allow it to clear away any dark thoughts, and fill your mind with peace and clarity. Feel the light moving down through your body, dissolving any heavy feelings and filling you with love and compassion.

When you're ready, think of a return cue. This could be a word, a sound, or an image that will help you return to this peaceful place whenever you need it. Remember that whenever you return to this space, you'll always feel safe and supported.

(PAUSE, 10 SEC)

Slowly bring your awareness back to the present moment. Take yourself out of the scene, and back to where you are right now. Remember that you've taken a step towards healing, and that you're carrying the sense of peace and calm with you.
