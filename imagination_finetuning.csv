I have a problem with my body image,"Notice now, how you are feeling…. how you are doing right now in this moment.

How does your body feel? Scan your body for a moment now, starting at your feet, simply noticing how your body is feeling.

Notice your feet… ankles… legs…. hips. Continue scanning your body, moving upward to your stomach, back, chest, sides. Mentally scan your hands, arms, and shoulders… your neck, head, and face.

Where is your body the most tense? Where is your body the most relaxed?

Just notice the state of tension and relaxation in your body.

Notice how your body relaxes… bit by bit…. without any effort on your part. See how your muscles become a little bit looser… less tense…. naturally, just because you are taking a moment to sit quietly and relax. Without any effort or input from you… without you even trying… your body becoming slightly more relaxed with each passing moment.

Think about your body image… what is body image? Maybe you think about the picture in your mind you have of what your body looks like. Maybe it’s the ideas you have about your body… your feelings about your physical self. Perhaps body image is is a vision of how you think your body should be. What does body image mean to you?

Take a moment now to consider your thoughts and ideas about your own body. How are you feeling right now, thinking about your body image? You might feel neutral, content, comfortable, uncomfortable, satisfied, dissatisfied, happy or unhappy, angry, afraid, accepting….. maybe a combination of things…. contradictory feelings are common…. and it is okay to feel however you are feeling.What might it be like to accept your body, just as it is? What if you felt okay about your physical self? Imagine for a few moments what that would be like.

Think about a time in your life when you felt accepting of your physical self – your whole self, or even part of yourself.Which parts of your body are the easiest for you to accept?

Imagine if you could accept your body as a whole, rather than as a collection of individual parts.

You have been doing some difficult thinking these last few moments. Let’s take a step back now, mentally, to relax.

Breathe in, deeply. And breathe out.

In…. and out…..

In… and out…..

Keep breathing deeply, slowly. It feels good to take deep, calm breaths.

Just relax for a moment while you notice your breathing. Just notice your breaths for a moment.

(pause)

If there are any areas where you are feeling tense, direct your attention to these areas as you breathe…. imagining that each breath in brings relaxation… and each breath out expels tension. Breathing in relaxation… and breathing out tension….. each breath relaxes you further.

(pause)

Now I will say some body image affirmations. You can repeat these if you wish, or simply relax as I talk.

Each affirmation is true…. even if it may not seem true right now.

Let’s begin the affirmations.

I am okay the way I am.

I can accept myself the way I am.

My body is acceptable just the way it is.

I am an okay person.

I accept this body I am in.

There is no need to be perfect.

My imperfections make me unique.

I am perfectly alright just the way I am.

My body is a functioning whole.

I am human, and all humans have flaws.

I can accept my imperfections.

I free myself from judging my body.

I am okay just the way I am.

I accept myself.

Now that you have repeated some affirmations, take note of how you are feeling. What was it like to repeat or listen to the affirmations?
It is okay to feel however you are feeling right now, good or bad. Accept the variety of feelings you may have.

Take a moment now to just relax. Let all the worries and tension go as you breathe slowly in… and out…. in…. out….. continue to breathe slowly, deeply…. naturally.

When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert.
Wake up your body and your mind. Move your arms and legs a little and feel your muscles reawakening.

I’ll count up now from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1 you will be fully awake and ready to return to your usual activities.

I am very angry ,"Anger is a normal and natural emotion, and there is nothing wrong with having feelings – you are human, after all. You have the power to decide how to deal with this emotion you are experiencing.

Anger management does not mean holding anger in. It does not mean that you will never feel angry. Anger management is managing the behavioral responses that can arise when you are feeling angry.

All you really need to do right now is take a few moments just to relax, for you, to help you feel relaxed and calm. It feels good to relax. After this short relaxation session is over, you can proceed with your day, and react in a way that you choose…. relaxing for a moment now will help you to react calmly, rather than acting out of emotion.It’s okay to be angry. Just allow yourself to feel however it is you are feeling right now, noticing this feeling, but not reacting just yet. All you’re doing is observing. Emotions are neither right nor wrong… they just are.

Take a deep breath in. Hold for a moment, and now breathe out.

Breathe in… hold that tension…. and now breathe out…. feeling the tension release with your breath.
Breathe in…. and out…….

in….. out…..

Keep breathing like this, slowly…. deeply…. and let your body relax a little.

Turn your attention again to how you are feeling. Notice the physical sensation of anger. Where in your body is the anger stored? Some people notice that they tighten their shoulders when they are feeling angry. Others who deal with anger notice clenched fists or tight jaws. Anger may be experienced as a feeling in the stomach…. the neck…. any one or a number of places in the body demonstrate physical symptoms of anger.

Many of these physical symptoms are uncomfortable. Some of these symptoms can be relieved right now, if you like, by relaxing your muscles. Let’s relax a few areas to begin this process to deal with anger by relaxing your muscles.

Starting with your hands and arms, first tighten your hands into fists. Feel the tension in your hands and arms. Hold…. tighter…. tighter…. and relax. Let go, allowing your hands and arms to be relaxed, loose, and limp. Notice the difference between tension and relaxation.

Now see if you can create a feeling of relaxation in your shoulders. Take a moment to relax your shoulders now. You may choose to tighten the muscles, and then relax, or you can simply relax your shoulders without tensing them first. Do whatever seems to work the best.

Focus now on your face and jaws. Relax your face and jaws, tensing first if you want to. Let all the tension leave your face….. let the tension leave your jaws…. leaving your face and jaws limp, smooth, and relaxed.

Scan your body now, for remaining areas of tension. Relax each area that feels tense…. scan your body from head to toe…. relaxing each part of your body.
(pause)

Take note of how you are feeling now. Physically. Emotionally.

You are controlling anger right now, just by the fact that you have not yet reacted with angry behaviors. You have chosen to relax, to deal with anger in a healthy way.

To increase the control you have over anger, you may want to repeat some affirmations to help create realistic, rational thinking…. also called self-control thoughts.

Here are 5 affirmations for anger management to help deal with anger:

I acknowledge that I am feeling angry right now, and accept the way I feel.

I have the power to control my reactions.

I can fully experience this anger, yet wait before I take action.

I can feel angry, but calm and in control at the same time.

It’s okay to feel angry.

Notice again how you are feeling. Physically, how are you feeling? Let your body relax a little more… relaxing any tense areas.Emotionally, how are you feeling? See how emotions come and go…. anger can come and go…. it will not last forever. There is a limited time where you exercise self-control, before the anger is no longer an issue.

You may feel less angry… just as angry… or more angry now than you were at the beginning of this relaxation session.

To deal with anger that may remain, you may need a way to express the anger and get it out. You do not have to keep your emotions inside… you can choose how to express them.You can let anger out by breathing deeply…. breathing in relaxation, and breathing out anger…. letting anger go with each breath.

There are other ways to express anger, too. You can do any of these activities after this script to allow yourself freedom to express the anger you experienced. Physical exercise, journaling, talking to someone you trust…. there are many ways to express yourself.

After the anger has decreased and you are feeling calm, you might want to address the situation that was upsetting by taking action to change the situation, or speaking to the person you were upset with. Or you may just choose to let the situation go.Once your anger has decreased you can choose whatever option seems best. You have the right to feel a range of emotions, including anger, and to express these emotions in healthy ways that you choose.

I’ll conclude this script with some breathing.

Take a deep breath in…. and out…..

in….. out…. relaxing with each breath

in….. out….

in….. out….

Keep breathing deeply to deal with anger and feel relaxed and calm.

Congratulate yourself for dealing with anger with relaxation.

I’ll count now from 5 to 1. Imagine that right now, you are at a 5, and that when I reach 1 you will be feeling awake and alert, yet calm, peaceful, and relaxed.

I have a low self esteem,"Find a comfortable position sitting or lying down. Notice how you are feeling right now…physically and mentally.

Take a deep breath in through your nose, and release the breath through your mouth.

Take another breath, and allow your breathing to relax you as you exhale fully.

Breathe in gently… and as you breathe out, let the air carry the tension out of your body.

Continue to breathe slowly and gently as you begin to focus on relaxing your body.

Notice where your body is tense. Focus your attention on one of these areas. As you breathe, picture that part of your body becoming slightly more relaxed than it was before. With each breath, that part of your body becomes a little more relaxed.Imagine what the relaxation feels like… tingly… soft… gentle… calm… loose… free… and let that feeling of relaxation grow.

Scan your body for any areas of tension, and for each area, let the relaxation soften the muscles as they give up their hold. Let the feeling of relaxation grow…spreading calm throughout your body.Breathe in relaxation… and breathe out tension…breathe in calm…and let all the tension go as you exhale…

Continue to breathe slowly, and gently, deepening your state of relaxation more and more with each breath. Deeper and deeper. More and more relaxed. Calm. At peace.

Create an image in your mind of your current state of being. Imagine the physical ailment that troubles you. It might be pain, or illness, or injury. It might be something diagnosed, or it may be a problem that is not yet identified. Whatever it is that you would like to heal, imagine this problem in your mind right now.

low confident and motivation ,"To begin the relaxation process, imagine that you are at the top of a stairway. At the bottom of the stairway is a state of peace, calm, and relaxation.

Take note of how you are feeling right now, at the top of the stairway.

Take a deep breath in… and out.

Breathe in…. and out.

Take another deep breath… and relax as you exhale.

Keep breathing slowly and deeply, remembering to exhale fully between each breath.

Imagine taking a step down the stairway… a single step closer to relaxation.

Further descend the stairway, going down toward relaxation….. down…. down…. to a state of calm and relaxation.

Picture yourself going slowly down the stairway, one step at a time. It is a comfortable, safe descent to a place of relaxation. Move down step by step, at your own pace, becoming more and more relaxed with each step you take.



Take another step down…. and another…. more deeply relaxed with each step. Feel your arms becoming very heavy. So heavy you can hardly lift them… it is a good feeling of relaxed heaviness. Allow your arms to rest at your sides… feeling loose and heavy. Your legs might even be getting heavier as well. Feel the heaviness in your legs… a warm, pleasant feeling.

You might even become a bit sleepy as you get closer and closer to relaxation. That’s okay. Allow your mind to drift and your body to relax, heavy and comfortable.



Moving down the stairway, down, down… almost to the bottom now…. when you reach the bottom you will be pleasantly relaxed. Notice how your whole body is relaxed and heavy now. Becoming more and more relaxed… deeper and deeper.

Take the last few steps down to the bottom of the stairway…..

Reaching the bottom now…. a state of calm and relaxation. Peaceful and relaxed.

Rest quietly for a few moments… enjoying the relaxation you are experiencing.

(pause)

Think now about a skill you would like to learn. Perhaps you want to learn an instrument, learn to play the guitar for example. Notice how being relaxed allows you to think with clarity, and prepares you for optimal learning.

You are fully capable of learning this new skill. Imagine yourself learning, practicing…. easily picking up the skills you desire. Easily memorizing and remembering the necessary details. Picture yourself as you learn an instrument…. learning to play skillfully, and enjoying the process. See yourself as you play for fun… and as you enjoy yourself, you are picking up on a new skill.


Imagine yourself playing the notes easily and accurately.

You may notice that you are filled with a desire to learn an instrument, full of motivation and interest in playing and learning.

You might even find yourself practicing for a few minutes each day to learn an instrument.

Notice that you can review mentally the process of playing the instrument. This mental practice is as effective as physically practicing.


Take a moment now to envision yourself practicing, learning this new skill that is important to you.

(pause)

This meditation to learn an instrument is most effective when followed by actual physical practice. Perhaps you will find a few minutes after this session concludes to actually pick up the instrument and practice.

Feel the excitement and interest… looking forward to the enjoyment you will experience with playing the instrument. Learning is enjoyable. Know that you will make mistakes as you go, and will learn from them in order to become even more skilled.



Take a few moments now to enjoy how relaxed you are feeling… and to enjoy the anticipation of looking forward to practicing…. eager to learn an instrument.

Feel your confidence building, knowing that you can quickly and easily expand your skills.

Enjoy the confidence, the anticipation, the interest you feel. Learning new skills enhances your life. You are probably looking forward to the richness this new skill…. this hobby… will bring.

(pause)

Take a few more moments to meditate on the idea of learning to play an instrument. Feeling a range of positive emotions as you think about the process.



Now it is time to conclude your relaxation experience, while keeping with you a relaxed feeling.

Imagine that you are at the bottom of a stairway. At the top of the stairway is a state of alert and calm. With each step up, you become more and more awake.

Picture yourself beginning to ascend the stairway. Taking a step up, becoming slightly more awake, more alert.


Take another step up, and another, feeling your body and mind reawaken more and more with each step.

Continue up the stairway, nearing the middle of the stairway. Becoming more awake. More alert. Feeling your energy increasing, flowing through your body.

Climb further up the stairway, another stair, and another, more awake with each one. Nearing the top of the stairway. Only three steps left before you reach your usual level of awareness, feeling calm yet alert and energized.

I nned to speak infron of audience and I very scared,"Get comfortable, preparing to relax. start to relax your body.



Take a deep breath in…. and breathe out……

In….. and out……

Continue to breathe deeply, slowly, and comfortably.

I’ll count down now, from 10… to 1. As I say each number, you can become more relaxed.

Let’s begin.

Very deeply relaxed and comfortable.

Allow this feeling of relaxation to grow… becoming even more relaxed…. calm and peaceful.

Keep with you the feeling of relaxation as you think about public speaking. Notice your reaction, physically and emotionally, to the concept of talking in public. Perhaps in the past this has been a source of anxiety for you… notice now how you can be relaxed and calm while thinking about speaking in front of others.

Calm and relaxed.

Peaceful and relaxed.

In the future you will know that the stress symptoms you may experience when faced with speaking publicly indicate excitement. This is a positive feeling, filling you with energy. The thought of speaking in front of people fills you with good feelings of excitement and anticipation.



You may even be feeling a bit excited now, just thinking about public speaking. Let this feeling subside as you return to a state of deep relaxation.

Take a deep breath in… hold…. and exhale.

Breathe in…. and out.

In…. out….

Continue to breathe deeply, noticing how you relax a bit more each time you exhale.

Breathe in…. and relax, breathing out.

In…. relax….

Breathe…. relax…..

Keep breathing slowly and calmly. You can relax like this any time you need to. Whenever you want to calm down, you can breathe deeply, and relax… like you are relaxing now.



(pause)

Now let’s begin a guided imagery exercise to allow you imagine successfully speaking in public, and enjoying the positive experience.

In this visualization, imagine that everything goes perfectly. Imagine what it would be like to be the most confident, best speaker a person could possibly be.

Create an image in your mind image of an excellent public speaker…. imagine a confident, well spoken person…. see that this person is you. Picture yourself as a superb speaker.



Begin to create a mental picture of yourself preparing to give a speech. Imagine that you are preparing in advance to speak. You are feeling confident, excited… you’re looking forward to speaking.

After your focused preparation, you are ready to speak. When the day arrives for you to speak, you are excited, eager to begin.

Imagine going to the location where you will speak. See yourself looking forward to speaking. You are excited, eager to talk in public. You can’t wait to share your knowledge. You have memorized the words easily, and know that they will come to you exactly as you need them.



Picture entering the location where you will speak… maybe it is an auditorium…. or another place. Many people are gathered to see you. You love it. They can’t wait to hear what you are going to say and you can’t wait to tell them.

imagine getting up to the front of the room, ready to speak. The crowd waits expectantly.

Picture all the details of this scene. See yourself standing at the front of the room, feeling confident. See the people in front of you, waiting to hear you speak.



Imagine yourself beginning your speech. Confident. Your phrases and words are well timed. All throughout your speech, you are breathing calmly, deeply… pausing between each sentence. You maintain a comfortable, smooth rhythm. You talk with smooth, clear speech. Ideas flow. Your hard work and extensive preparation allow your speaking to be easy, automatic, almost rote. Everything seems so familiar. It is such a great feeling.

Imagine giving your speech. See yourself as you enjoy this moment. You are confident, comfortable, and having a great time.The anticipatory excitement you felt at the beginning has smoothed into a feeling of confidence and calm.

You feel so at home in front of all these people. They listen, enjoying hearing you speak as much as you are enjoying speaking. You enjoy this experience immensely.


When you reach your conclusion, and speak the final words of your prepared speech, imagine giving the audience time to ask questions. You answer every question easily and proficiently. See your excellent answers satisfying each member of the audience.

The audience is pleased with your performance. You are pleased with your performance. The exhilaration at having completed this public speaking fills you with happiness, contentment, and pride. It feels great to have done this. You are a little bit disappointed it is over because you enjoyed it so much.

Notice how you can feel confident and calm when doing public speaking. This includes giving prepared speeches, responding to questions, talking spontaneously to strangers…. you are skilled and able to do any sort of public speaking. You are able to relax before, during, or after you speak. You are confident and assertive.


Practicing this visualization in your mind is like performing actual public speaking. If you are able to do this visualization and be calm, you can also speak in public calmly. Congratulate yourself for completing this challenge.

Now that you have completed this public speaking guided imagery, take a few moments to reawaken your mind and body… gradually becoming more alert.

I’ll count to 5. When I reach 5, you will be fully awake and feeling calm and energized.

1… becoming more awake and alert

2…. feeling your mind and body reawaken

3…. move your muscles a little

4…. almost completely awake now

5…. feeling full of energy and refreshed."
I am very shy,"Take a deep breath in…. and exhale slowly.



Breathe in again…. and out.

In…. out.

In…. out.

Keep breathing slowly, smoothly.

Allow your body to begin to relax. The first thing you might notice is that your muscles begin to let go of some of the tension they were holding. Feel your shoulders easing downward, relaxing and giving up all the tension. Your arms are feeling heavy… getting heavier…. and heavier… and they pull downward gently, moving your shoulders even lower, into a loose, relaxed position.

As you relax, you may notice your eyelids starting to feel heavy. Very heavy…. each blink becoming slow…. moving the heaviness of your eyelids… until opening your eyes becomes an effort. It would feel so good to close your eyes…. go ahead and relax, allowing your eyes to close.

Notice the rest of your body relaxing. Your legs are very heavy…. so heavy and limp. Allow the muscles of your neck and back to relax. Let your hands and your feet relax. Relax your head and face.



Focus your attention for a moment on the center of your body. Let a feeling of relaxation grow, feeling the relaxation in your chest and stomach. Each breath you take can relax you even more… filling your lungs with relaxation.

Sit quietly for a moment, relaxing… letting the relaxation deepen as you breathe slowly and smoothly.



(pause)

Start to create an image in your mind. Imagine yourself feeling confident, interacting with others positively. What would it be like if you were very confident? Imagine how you would behave…. how you would carry yourself. See in your mind your confident facial expression…. your self-assured posture….

How would this confident you behave? Imagine yourself if you were completely confident and did not feel shy. See yourself feeling calm and confident.

Now focus for a moment on relaxation. Turn your attention to your breathing, and feel yourself becoming more relaxed with each breath.



Take a calming breath in… and breathe slowly out…

Breathe in… and out.

Feel yourself relaxing more with each breath as you keep breathing slowly and calmly.

Turn your attention now to a situation where you would need to interact with others. See your confident self in this situation… feeling good.

Imagine all the details… see yourself talking to others. Notice your slow, steady heart rate. See how steady your hands are and how smooth your voice is. See yourself smiling, calm, speaking out loud to individuals or groups…. It feels good to imagine yourself handling all kinds of social situations positively.

(pause)

Now change the visualization slightly, to imagine the shyness itself. Picture what it is like to be shy. What does shyness mean to you? Perhaps shyness means a difficulty speaking to others. Maybe it is a feeling of embarrassment in public, or a tendency to be quiet around people. Think of what it means to you to be shy.



(pause)

You can overcome shyness. The most effective way for overcoming shyness is to challenge the shyness by facing head on the situations that are the most difficult. Picture your most difficult situation… the one where you experience the most shyness. You can practice facing this situation in your imagination, and then you can face this situation in real life. You will be able to handle the situation positively, with confidence, and overcome shyness.

Walk yourself through the situation now in your mind. Picture as many details as you can…. and see yourself handling the challenge, facing directly the situation in which you feel the most shy. Picture the confident self you were imagining a few moments ago, and see yourself facing a situation where you felt shy in the past. See yourself overcoming shyness.

It’s okay if you feel nervous… this feeling of nervousness will go away as soon as you see how capable you are. You are stronger and more capable of overcoming shyness than you may realize. Take a few moments now to mentally face the situation where you experience the most shyness.



(pause)

Imagine your future self…. a self who is not shy. See that this exact same person is present already, within you. You have a confident, positive self within you, just waiting to come to the surface. Imagine how good it will feel overcoming shyness and being filled with a feeling of confidence.

Simply relax… feeling confident. Knowing you will achieve self-assurance, and the ability to interact with others and feel great. Overcoming shyness is possible. You are capable of overcoming shyness. Experience these feelings of self-assurance and calm right now.

(pause)

Foster this feeling of confidence… and allow it to grow… enjoying how it feels to be relaxed and confident.



(pause)

Take a few moments to hold with you a picture of self-assurance that you can recall in the future. Memorize this feeling of calm relaxation and confidence.

You can remember this feeling again in the future…. any time you need to face a situation where you experience shyness, you can recall this feeling of confidence and relaxation, and experience this feeling again. Holding this self-assurance, you can get through challenging situations. You can use this confidence in overcoming shyness.

You may even find that soon, maybe today, maybe tomorrow… you will feel motivated to face a situation that is challenging for you. Most likely, you will want to seek out other people, and talk with them…. and you might even find that you feel confident, calm, not shy at all. It feels good overcoming shyness. It feels good to face situations that are challenging.



(pause)

To conclude this overcoming shyness relaxation session, you may want to drift off to sleep, or you might decide to reawaken and resume your usual activities.

If you choose to sleep, simply let the relaxation deepen until you drift off into pleasant sleep.

If you decide to reawaken, move your arms and legs a little, feeling your muscles waking up. Let your attention return to the present, and your mind and body return to their usual level of alertness and wakefulness.



I’ll count back from 3 to 1, and upon reaching 1 you will either become fully awake or drift off to sleep, keeping with you a feeling of calm and self-assurance.

I have an exam tomorrow,"Start to relax your body, taking a deep breath in…. and out.

Breathe in again…. and exhale fully.

Breathe in…. and out.

In…. out.

Keep breathing, letting each breath relax you.

Notice some key areas in your body where tension tends to build. Your shoulders, hands, back, neck, and jaws. Focus first on your shoulders. See how your shoulders relax as soon as your attention is focused on them. Feel the muscles loosening, and your shoulders lowering… relaxing.

Let your jaws relax, letting your lower jaw drop slightly, leaving a space between your upper and lower teeth. Feel the muscles of your face becoming smooth, loose, and relaxed.



Turn your attention to your neck. See how you can let the tension go, relaxing the muscles of your neck. Let the relaxation continue down the length of your spine, relaxing all the muscles. Feel the relaxation in your neck and back.

Now focus on your hands. Open and close your hands a few times, wiggle your fingers, and then relax. Let your hands be limp and loose, resting in your lap or at your sides.



Scan your body now for any other areas that are tense. For each one, imagine directing your breath to that area. Imagine breathing in relaxation…. and breathing out tension. Breathing in a feeling of relaxation, and exhaling all the tension. Feel your muscles relaxing with each breath.

Continue to scan your body, relaxing each area that feels tense.

(pause)

Now you are feeling calm and relaxed. Your whole body feels relaxed and heavy.

Begin to visualize now the process of preparation for writing an exam. The first stage is motivation. Imagine how it would feel to be filled with motivation and drive, feeling compelled to study and write a test.

Fully imagine this feeling, and allow yourself to experience it completely. Feel motivation.

(pause)

You are so eager to write an exam.

Imagine now the preparation leading up to writing a test. Picture yourself studying… interested, motivated, eager. Enjoying the process of assimilating new information. You are confident and capable. See yourself studying, remembering the material, and feeling energized by this process.



See yourself studying several times, reading, writing, speaking… reviewing the information you need and committing it to memory.

(pause)

Now see yourself in your mind’s eye… you have studied and are prepared for the exam. You are feeling a bit excited to write a test and share your knowledge…. but at the same time you are feeling calm and confident about the prospects of writing a test.

Imagine yourself during the examination. See how easy it is to recall the information you studied. Picture yourself confidently writing an exam, easily drawing upon your knowledge, answering every question, and knowing you have it right.



Some of the questions are easy, and you answer them quickly. Some questions are difficult, requiring intense thought. You were expecting this, and you are prepared. Imagine yourself as you write an exam, taking a moment to breathe deeply, slowly, calmly…. feeling your body relax and allowing your mind to become calm. In this state of calm, you are able to focus… and you answer the difficult questions thoughtfully. You experience mental clarity and concentration.

Take a few moments now to imagine the process of writing a test, feeling calm and confident, and seeing yourself answering questions successfully.

(pause)

Picture now, that you have finished the exam. See yourself feeling confident and gratified, though you have not yet recieved the results. You are feeling proud of yourself for your accomplishments of studying and writing an exam. You feel calm and confident while you wait for the exam results. You may find out soon how you did, or may have to wait.



Imagine getting the exam results. Feeling confident and excited…. and seeing the results: you passed! You receive an excellent grade, exactly what you were hoping for. This feeling of success and accomplishment is so wonderful, you want to write another exam just to experience it all again.

Enjoy the feelings of success.

(pause)

Take a moment to reflect upon the process of writing an exam – motivation, preparation, writing the exam, and finding out the results. Reflect upon this process feeling calm and interested.

(pause)

Now you have completed this visualization experience…. feeling mentally prepared for the process of preparing for and writing an exam. You may even find that completing this guided imagery exercise helps you to feel motivated. You may find that immediately after this session, you pursue one of the steps for writing an exam… perhaps you feel inclined to prepare and study…. or maybe to write the exam itself. You can anticipate success in whatever stage you are at. You are calm, confident, and in control.



Begin to wake up your mind and body…. returning your awareness to the present.

Wiggle your fingers, feeling your hands and arms reawakening.

Wake up your feet and legs by wiggling your toes.

Shrug your shoulders… turn your head from side to side…. feel your body waking up.

When you are feeling awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, feeling energized, motivated, and confident."
I have nightmars,"Let’s begin the relaxation exercise. Perhaps you have just had a nightmare…. or maybe you are getting ready to sleep and want to fill your mind with peaceful images… or perhaps you have woken up in the night and want to get back to sleep. Maybe you just want to promote positive mental images to help you relax. Whatever the case may be, this relaxation to get rid of nightmares can help to create a peaceful mental state.

Positive images can help to get rid of nightmares.

This guided imagery will help get rid of nightmares and create a positive place in your mind. Positive visualization can create this place.

Imagine a place that is perfectly safe, and very comfortable. Imagine what this place would be like. Create an image in your mind of all the details of a safe, peaceful place.

With this image in mind, begin to relax your body. Fear creates tension, and to get rid of nightmares it is important to decrease this tension. Start by noticing where the tension is in your body. Pay close attention to your shoulders, neck, back, hands, and jaws. These are areas where tension tends to build up.



Once you have located the tension in your body, choose one area to relax first. Focus your attention on this area, and consciously allow the muscles to relax, and soften, becoming loose. Breathe, imagining that your breath brings relaxation to this area. Feel the tension leave as you breathe out.

Breathe in relaxation…. and breathe out tension. Keep breathing, letting your breaths be slow and regular.


Notice that the area you were focusing on is more relaxed than it was before. See how you have the ability to relax your muscles.

Feel your muscles relaxing further. Notice your jaws relaxing, becoming loose, your mouth resting comfortably with your teeth slightly apart. Feel your neck and shoulders relaxing, and your shoulders getting lower as the muscles give up their hold.

Allow your hands to relax, resting… open, loose, relaxed.

Feel your back relax. All the muscles become soft and loose.

To get rid of nightmares, let’s create a positive image to focus on.

Imagine that you are at a luxurious resort where you are completely safe and cared for. Your room is spacious, sunny, and comfortable.


In this place, you have no worries. There is nothing you need to do. You are here just to relax and take time for yourself.

The room you are staying in is very luxurious. You have a large space with everything you need – kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, living room. Picture being in a large room that is just for relaxation and enjoyment. This room is your own private escape. Here is a warm pool, a soft, comfortable lounge chair, plants, and large windows. The sun streams through the windows, making the pool sparkle.

Take in this scene, imagining this lovely place. Though this room is indoors, the plants and pool create an almost outdoors feel. Through the windows you can see a beautiful view. Imagine where your resort is located. What do you see outside? Your resort can be anywhere you like… by the ocean, in the mountains, on a golf course, an oasis in the desert…. your resort can be anywhere you like. Imagine the picturesque view you would see out the windows.



The room is warm, with a soft breeze created by silent fans. Imagine yourself here, in this safe, luxurious, beautiful place. You may see yourself walking toward the pool, or sitting in the lounge chair. Here you can do whatever you wish.

I’ll pause for one minute. For the the next minute, imagine the relaxing things you can do here, and create picture in your mind of you relaxing in this peaceful place.

(pause)

Now imagine resting on the lounge chair. Feel the sun shining down, as you become warm and relaxed. The chair is very soft, and as you recline, laying back and closing your eyes, you feel so at peace.



You are so comfortable here. Feel yourself sinking into the lounge chair, sinking deeper into relaxation.

Notice the peaceful thoughts that are filling your mind. See that by focusing on these thoughts, they become stronger… filling your consciousness with peace. The peaceful thoughts are very clear… increasing in clarity as you focus.

All other thoughts and concerns are far away right now. As you sleep, your mind can remain in this positive place. Feel yourself drifting off to sleep, filled with peaceful, pleasant thoughts. Beautiful, serene dreams occupy your consciousness.



Calm…. peace…. relaxed….

Thoughts that enter your awareness can pass lazily through your mind, like clouds drifting by…. you don’t need to focus especially on any of them. You are so calm. Allow your thoughts to pass without dwelling on them. You can get rid of nightmares by allowing the negative images and thoughts to leave your mind, as they are replaced by images of the peaceful resort in your imagination.

Turn your attention again to the pool and lounge chair you imagined. See this peaceful place, just for you. Only pleasant thoughts remain here. This place is a retreat from all stresses and worries.

Any time worried thoughts arise, focus again on the resort. A luxurious, safe place where you can get away from the life’s stresses, get rid of nightmares, and just relax. See all the details of this place. You can picture yourself enjoying the pool and sun room… or having a warm bath in a jacuzzi tub. Perhaps you imagine getting into a large, soft, comfortable bed and having a nap. Your suite has a variety of things for you to enjoy, and is a place just for you, where you can relax.



Relax here…. resting…. enjoying this holiday. Fill your mind with happiness and peace.

(pause)

Now, if you want to, you can drift off to sleep. Ever so slowly drifting down into a pleasant, calm land of dreams.

Slipping deeper and deeper….

I’ll count now from 1 to 5. When you reach 5 you will be fully relaxed and asleep.

1… becoming heavier, sleepy and relaxed.

2…. safe and warm, comfortably floating… drifting…. relaxed

3…. pleasant, peaceful, happy thoughts fill your mind

4…. so deeply relaxed

5…. drifting into deep sleep, filled with pleasant dreams."
I have flashbacks from bad times,"Part of this relaxation exercise will guide you to imagine that the flashbacks are like images on a TV screen, so if you want to face the fearful thoughts, you can do so. If you do not feel ready to face the images, this script includes ways of orienting yourself to the present any time you need to.

Start by making yourself as physically comfortable as possible. You might want to sit or lie down. It can be helpful to wrap a blanket snugly around your shoulders, if you have one available. The even pressure can be calming.



The flashbacks you experience are truly frightening, but the images you have are not happening in the present. Even though flashbacks seem very real, they are only real in the past. They are not real right now.

Nothing dangerous is happening right now, even though it can feel like you are in danger.



You will get through this and you will be okay. You might not feel okay right now, but soon you will be feeling calm and relaxed.

Let’s take a few moments to breathe. Breathe slowly with me now as I count.

Breathe in… 2…3….4…hold…2….3…. exhale…2….3…4….5…

Breathe in… 2…3….4…hold…2….3…. exhale…2….3…4….5…

Breathe in… 2…3….4…hold…2….3…. exhale…2….3…4….5…

Keep breathing slowly like this. See how calm breathing can start to center you.

During flashbacks, your attention is completely on your internal world. Relaxation can be focused on your internal world too, but on positive sensations rather than negative ones.



Focus for the next few moments on your external environment instead of your internal one. First, look around at the room you are in. Notice the details here. See the surface you are on. If you are indoors, notice the walls and ceiling around you. See the colours around you.

Now rub your hands together. Feel the friction between your palms. Feel your hands warming up a little. As your hands are warming, they are also relaxing. Now place your hands at your sides, and just notice the warmth in your hands.

Feel the surface you are on. Feel your clothes against your body. If you did choose to wrap a blanket around your shoulders, feel the comforting pressure the blanket provides.



If it is difficult to keep your attention on your environment, you can help to return your attention to the present with some physical cues. Place your hands on your knees. Now pat your knees gently, and hear the sound of your hands tapping your knees. Feel the gentle pressure with each tap.

Now rub your hands together again, focusing your attention on this sensation.

You can even place your hands on your face, and allow a gentle, firm pressure on your cheeks to calm you.

Breathe slowly, calmly…. in… and out….. in…. out…. keep your breathing slow and regular.

Take a moment now to rub your hands together slowly while you breathe slowly. This calming motion can be a way to center yourself. As you continue this relaxation exercise, you can rub your hands together while breathing slowly. This can be a safe escape for you if the flashbacks get to be too much. You can take a break by rubbing your hands together and breathing slowly, any time you need to.



Now you can turn your attention to your thoughts. It’s okay if you experience flashbacks. I’ll be here to talk you through it. You have handled this before, and I know it is scary, but you can handle it now, too. You will get through this, and when it’s over, you will feel so much better.

Maybe you are experiencing flashbacks right now, or perhaps have been throughout this exercise. Maybe you have experienced flashbacks in the past, but are not at the moment.

If you feel ready, it’s okay to face those thoughts right now. If the images get too real, remember to take a break by rubbing your hands together and breathing slowly. This action will bring you back to the present, where you can remember that you will get through this and that the reality around you is neutral and safe.



I would like to take you mentally to a place of safety. Let these words guide you to a place where the flashbacks are like images on a television screen instead of part of reality. It may be frightening to watch, and at times it may seem real, but you know that the experience of flashbacks is only as real as the images on a screen. You may have visual pictures, sounds, or physical feelings. Put them all on the screen in front of you, and you can observe them just like a movie.

This movie on the screen may be horrific, but it will be over soon. All you need to do right now is make yourself as comfortable as possible while the scary scenes pass. If you need to look away from the screen, it’s okay. You can close your eyes, or concentrate just on breathing, or do whatever else you need to do right now to cope with flashbacks.

Let’s spend one minute here in front of this screen. I’ll be here to talk you through it.



You are doing fine. It’s okay to be scared, or uncomfortable…. it’s okay to feel however you are feeling.

It’s okay to be frightened. It’s natural to feel unsafe when you are watching something so scary.

I know this is hard. But you’re getting through it. The images are not real right now, they are from the past. You are not in that place again. You are simply observing the flashback scenes on a TV screen. You know they are not real.



The minute is up. You did it.

Imagine turning the television screen off. See the flashback images and sensations disappear.

Now rub your hands together…. breathe in… and out….. in…. and out….. Let your hands rest at your sides as you continue to breathe slowly and focus on the present. See where you really are right now.

You survived your fears. You are here, now, safe.

Look around, eyes open, observing where you are. Return to the here and now.

You may want to move around a bit to fully orient yourself to the present. Stretch your arms and legs. When you are ready, stand up, and just stand quietly for a moment, looking around.

Now take a few steps, walking around, fully present wherever you are.

When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to your usual activities, keeping with you a feeling of serenity, safety, and calm."
I have a headach,"Before you begin, take note of how you are feeling. Notice your headache. If you were to rate the severity of this headache, with zero being no pain at all and 10 being the worst imaginable pain, what rating would you assign right now? Rate your headache from zero to 10.  



Find a comfortable position – sitting in a supportive chair or lying down are ideal – and start to relax your body with some gentle stretches. During this headache relief script, stop or ease up if you experience pain or discomfort. Listen to your body and make sure to stretch gently and safely.   

Lower your left ear toward your left shoulder. Return to center. Lower your right ear toward your right shoulder. Return to center. Repeat, leaning left…. center…. right…. center…. left…. center…. right….. center.  



Now lower your chin toward your chest. Allow the weight of your head to stretch the back of your neck, with your muscles relaxed…. No force….. just allow your head to hang forward.  

Keeping your head forward, roll slightly to the left and upward, back to center… now slightly to the right and upward. Your head will move left to right, tracing a slight U shape. Left… forward…. right…..forward…. left…… forward….. right….. forward.  



Now return to a neutral position. Look up, gently leaning your head back to stretch the front of your neck. Return to neutral. Look up one more time, stretching…. relaxing…. and return to neutral.  

Bring your shoulders up toward your ears…. hold….. now lower your shoulders. Bring them even lower still…. Return to neutral. Repeat one more time, raising your shoulders up….. and then lowering them…. Now relax your shoulders into a low neutral position.  

Shake your shoulders front to back by bringing your left shoulder back a short distance while you move your right shoulder forward a small amount. Now move your right shoulder back and the left one forward. Repeat rapidly… shake….. shake….. shake. Relax your shoulders now. Feel the tension leaving your body as you relax. Notice the beginning of headache relief as your muscles relax and let go.  


Focus now on your breathing. Breathe in deeply. Feel the air you breathe in relax and sooth you. Exhale fully, breathing out all the air…. Relaxing as you breathe out.  

Take another deep breath in….. and out….. in…… out….  

Continue breathing deeply.  

Turn your attention now to your headache. Where is the rating right now, from zero to 10? Allow the headache relief to occur as you relax further.  

Notice specifically where the pain is located. When you breathe in, imagine that you are breathing relaxation into this area. When you breathe out, imagine exhaling away tension. In your mind, direct your breath to this area.  


Imagine now that your feet are warm, becoming even warmer. Feel the warmth increasing in your feet and in your legs.  

Notice your hands, and imagine that the palms of your hands are warming. Picture your hands becoming warm and heavy…. Your arms also becoming warm and relaxed.  

Your arms and legs are very heavy and very warm. Very relaxed. Allow the warmth in your arms and legs to increase. Warmer and warmer.  



Turn your attention to your forehead. Imagine that your forehead is smooth and cool. Feel the coolness on your forehead – as if a block of ice is a few inches away from your skin, and you can feel the cool air from the ice moving gently across the skin of your forehead. Your forehead feels quite cool – you can feel that the ice is very near, but it does not touch your skin.  

Allow the feeling of coolness to move along the surface of your face and head. Starting from your eyebrows, feel the cool air on your eyelids and cheeks. Feel the coolness spreading to the top of your head, the sides of your head, the back of your head. It is so pleasant and cool. The coolness provides headache relief.  

Imagine wrapping your head in a cool, wet cloth. Imagine the first strip of cloth laying across your forehead, and then above your left ear, around the back of your head, above your right ear, and over your forehead again. Imagine wrapping your head completely in comforting, soothing coolness. It is wrapped fairly tightly, and the pressure feels good. It pushes away the pain you were experiencing, leaving only a calming firm touch. It is very cool.  



Imagine that the cloth that wraps your head becomes slightly looser. Feel your body relaxing, just as the cloth is relaxing…..  

You can barely feel the cloth on your skin now, as it becomes looser still. You are feeling very comfortable and relaxed. Let a feeling of relaxation begin at the very top of your head. It might feel heavy… or light… it might feel tingly….. feel the relaxation at the top of your head.  

Allow the feeling of relaxation and to grow, expanding with each breath you take. The air you breathe in adds to the relaxation. The calm and relaxation you are experiencing allows you to experience headache relief. The relaxation is like a bubble of peace and calm, growing larger and larger as more relaxation is added each time you breathe in. The area around the relaxation gets smaller with each breath out as you exhale any feelings of tension.  



Let the relaxation grow, spreading to your eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, cheeks, nose, mouth, chin.  Feel the relaxation filling up the space inside your head. Relaxing the top of your head, the back of your head, the sides of your head, your ears.  

Feel the very top of your neck relaxing, and the tingly feeling of relaxation spreading down the back of your neck…. the sides of your neck….. the front of your neck…. Your shoulders.  

With each breath, imagine the relaxation filling your body more and more. Growing downward from your shoulders…. Reaching the level of your elbows and belly button. Relaxation growing, reaching the level of your hips….. knees…. All the way down to your feet.  

Your entire body is loose, comfortable, heavy, and relaxed.   

Feel any pain or discomfort dissipating, dissolving…. Becoming smaller and smaller as the relaxation grows.  

You can become even more deeply relaxed as you focus again on your breathing. Do not try to change anything, simply notice your breathing and focus your attention on each breath.  

For the next 2 minutes, repeat “I am” each time you inhale, and “relaxed” each time you exhale.  

I am…..  

Relaxed…..  

I am…..  

Relaxed…..  

Continue on your own for a few moments. As your thoughts wander, simply return your attention to the words you are repeating in this headache relief script.  

(pause)  

I am…..  

Relaxed…..  

I am…..  

Relaxed…..  

You are deeply relaxed. Let your thoughts drift now for a few moments as you simply enjoy the feeling of relaxation. Enjoy the feeling of headache relief. Complete and total relaxation, peace, and calm. Pleasant headache relief. Peaceful and relaxed.  

(pause)  

You have completed the relaxation for headache relief script. You can choose now to become alert and awake, or drift off to sleep.  

I will count from 5 to 1. If you choose to reawaken, become more alert with each number, until at 1 you are fully awake. If you decide to sleep, you can drift off as I count.

I have obsessive thougths,"Begin by getting comfortable, adjusting your position as needed so you can start to relax.

To begin the relaxation process, imagine that you are at the top of a stairway. At the bottom of the stairway is a state of peace, calm, and relaxation.

Take note of how you are feeling right now, at the top of the stairway.

Imagine taking a step down the stairway…a single step closer to relaxation.

Further descend the stairway, going down toward relaxation…down…down…to a state of calm and relaxation.

Picture yourself going slowly down the stairway, one step at a time. It is a comfortable, safe descent to a place of relaxation. Move down step by step, at your own pace, becoming more and more relaxed with each step you take.

Take another step down…and another…more deeply relaxed with each step.

You might even become a bit sleepy as you get closer and closer to relaxation. That’s okay. Allow your mind to drift and your body to relax, heavy and comfortable.



Moving down the stairway, down, down…almost to the bottom now…when you reach the bottom you will be pleasantly relaxed.

Take the last few steps down to the bottom of the stairway…

Reaching the bottom now…a state of calm and relaxation. You are now feeling peaceful and relaxed.



Now, in this calmer state, consider the obsessive thoughts that tend to be problematic for you. People who experience Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often feel helpless against obsessive thoughts. It can feel like the only way to get rid of the thoughts is to give in to certain behaviors, or compulsions.

You may feel compelled to avoid things, check things, count, worry, or do some other repetitive behavior. The best way to get rid of obsessive thoughts for good is to resist the compulsive behaviors and ride out the anxiety. Nothing bad is going to happen if you resist the compulsions.

Notice the obsessive thoughts right now, without taking any action to relieve this anxiety. Notice the thoughts that you are having. Focus on the thing that you are worrying about.


These thoughts will not last forever. They will go away soon, without you following through on compulsive behaviors. The urge to engage in these behaviors will pass. The anxiety will go away. Just experience this anxiety right now, without fighting it, allowing the anxiety to happen.

You are safe. Nothing bad is going to happen. You are okay, and you are riding this out.

It’s perfectly okay to distract yourself. Let’s try it, right now, by focusing on breathing.

Take a deep breath in…hold…and breathe out.

Breathe in…and out…

In…and out…

In…out…

Keep breathing slowly, concentrating on your breathing…focusing all of your attention on each breath you take.


(Pause)

Now focus on your muscles. Notice where there is tension in your body…and notice where your body feels relaxed.

Choose one area of tension, and allow this area to relax. Breathe in…and as you breathe out, let the muscles loosen, giving up tension.

Feel this area becoming more relaxed.

Now choose another area of tension, and relax the muscles there.

Continue to scan your body for areas of tension, relaxing each tense spot that you find.


(Pause)

Notice how you are feeling now. You are probably feeling more relaxed. See how you can relax your body, and feel more calm, without needing to act on the obsessive thoughts. Notice that by focusing on something else, such as concentrating on relaxing your muscles, you get some relief from the obsessive thoughts.

When thoughts come up, simply notice them, and then direct your attention to something else. You do not need to fight the thoughts, or try to make them go away…the thoughts will go away on their own.

All you need to do is make yourself as comfortable as you can, so that you are able to get through this stressful time. You will get through this. You are doing well.


If you start to feel too anxious, just focus on your breathing, or on relaxing your muscles, and feel the anxiety decrease.

Create a picture in your mind now, of yourself in the situation related to your obsessive thoughts. For example, if your thoughts are about contamination, imagine yourself touching a feared object. If your thoughts are about the need to check to see if the stove is off, imagine yourself getting ready to leave the house. If you have thoughts about the need to wash your hands, picture yourself standing in front of a sink. Imagine yourself in whatever situation the obsessive thoughts are about.

See yourself in this situation. What would the most healthy, effective response be? Imagine a response that does not involve compulsions…one that you would do if you did not have any obsessive thoughts.


Picture yourself doing the behavior you avoid, or doing a different behavior than the one you usually do. For example, picture yourself touching an object you are afraid to have contact with, and imagine it going just fine. See yourself leaving the house without checking the stove, and imagine yourself as you keep going, without looking back.

Create all the details of the scenario in your mind. Rehearse a new behavior in your mind…as if the obsessive thoughts have no power over you.

The obsessive thoughts do not have any power over you. You can endure the anxiety that comes up, and you will not have to endure it for long because the anxiety goes away. You only need to ride it out…waiting for the anxiety to pass…


You are stronger than the obsessive thoughts. You are much stronger…imagine yourself handling situations in a healthy, uninhibited way…free from obsessive thoughts…free from worries. Rehearse these behaviors in your mind.

(Pause)

For relief from the obsessive thoughts, you can relax your body, which we will do again in a moment. You can also practice the behaviors you have been imagining. The best way to get rid of obsessive thoughts is to actually do new behaviors in real life. Endure the anxiety when it comes up, and it will go away without giving in to the thoughts. The anxiety and the thoughts will go away all on their own.

When obsessive thoughts become too difficult to resist, you can use relaxation to help you through it. All you need to do is to get through some anxiety temporarily…and eventually the obsessive thoughts will go away. They have no power over you now, even though this may be difficult.


You are in control. You are much stronger than the thoughts. You can resist giving into the thoughts. This will get easier and easier to do.

Focus now on relaxation. Every time the obsessive thoughts become problematic, just focus again on relaxation.

Concentrate on your hands. Feel the relaxation in your hands. Feel your hands becoming warmer, and heavier…relaxing…


Follow this relaxation as it spreads to your wrists…lower arms…and elbows.

Feel your upper arms and shoulders relaxing.

Allow the muscles of your neck…face…and head to relax.

Feel your upper back relaxing…and feel the relaxation continue all the way down your back…

Relax your sides…chest…and stomach.

Allow your hips and upper legs to relax…relax your knees….lower legs….ankles….and feet.

Allow a feeling of relaxation to fill your entire body. Let your whole body become relaxed and heavy.

Focus on your breathing…observing each breath moving in and out of your body…watching your breaths…concentrating on your breathing.

Feel yourself becoming even more deeply relaxed as you breathe…more and more relaxed.

So calm…so peaceful…completely relaxed…

(Pause)

Notice how relaxed you are feeling. Such a pleasant, calm feeling.

You were feeling anxious before, but you got through it. You have overpowered the obsessive thoughts that were bothering you. Any time you experience these thoughts again, you can relax and get through it, just like you did now.

Congratulate yourself on having gotten through this. This is proof that you are stronger than the obsessive thoughts. These thoughts have no power over you.

Now it is time to conclude your relaxation experience, while keeping with you a relaxed feeling.

Imagine that you are at the bottom of a stairway. At the top of the stairway is a state of alert and calm. With each step up, you become more and more awake.


Picture yourself beginning to ascend the stairway. Taking a step up, becoming slightly more awake, more alert.

Take another step up, and another, feeling your body and mind reawaken more and more with each step.

Continue up the stairway, nearing the middle of the stairway. Becoming more awake. More alert. Feeling your energy increasing, flowing through your body.



Climb further up the stairway…another stair…and another…more awake with each one. Nearing the top of the stairway. Only three steps left before you reach your usual level of awareness, feeling calm yet alert and energized.

Three…two…one."
I am very lonely,"Before you deal with loneliness, begin by becoming more relaxed. Choose a comfortable position, and take a few moments just to breathe.

Allow yourself to breathe slowly and naturally, doing nothing else in this moment besides concentrating on your breaths.

Breathe in…and out…allowing each breath to calm and relax you.

Continue breathing calmly, at whatever pace is comfortable for you.

Let’s use mental focus to help you relax. All you need to do is count up from one to five, then back down to one. I’ll count with you for a while, and then you can count on your own. Try to count in time with your breathing, counting each time you breathe out.

Keep counting on your own now. Allow your muscles to become relaxed and loose…and focus completely on the numbers…becoming more and more relaxed with each number…more deeply relaxed…

(Pause)

Now let’s start to deal with loneliness. Think for a moment about how you are feeling. Notice any feelings of loneliness you may have…what does the loneliness feel like? Some people experience a heavy feeling in the stomach…or a feeling of emptiness or aching in the chest. What does loneliness feel like to you? You don’t need to start dealing with the loneliness just yet…simply experience it…noticing what it is like.


(Pause)

Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling…but stay with this feeling for a few more moments. You do not need to deal with loneliness yet, just notice the feeling. This lonely feeling you are experiencing can be a signal that you have needs that are not being met right now. Your mind is speaking to you through this feeling, telling you that something needs to change, whether your situation, your outlook, or your actions.

You can use this feeling of loneliness to explore what it is that you need, and to make changes to deal with loneliness so you can feel content. Concentrate on the feeling of loneliness. What are you thinking about when you focus on the loneliness? Perhaps you have images in your mind of ways that you want your life to be different. Maybe you are thinking about being alone. Maybe you miss someone. What thoughts or images go through your mind as you focus on being lonely?

(Pause)

There are two solutions to deal with loneliness. One is to increase the connections and contact you have with others. The other way to deal with loneliness is to have a positive relationship with yourself, and appreciate your company. Both of these remedies are available to you. You can use both, without having to choose one or the other.


To start to deal with loneliness, let’s focus for a moment on connections with people. Maybe you are feeling lonely right now because you are by yourself, with no one else around, or you could be feeling lonely even with others around, if you do not feel sufficiently connected to the person or people around you.

Think about how many times you connected with another person in the past week. If you were to guess as to how many connections you had, what would the number be?

We have connections with many people on various levels. Connections can range from a simple acknowledgment, (for example, saying hello to a stranger or to the person who works in the grocery store) to close relationships. Think about the past week, and remember the people you interacted with. Did you have any telephone conversations? Did you read or send any emails? Did you say hello to anyone in the store? Did you read or write any letters? Did you visit with any friends?


Think about the number of connections you had in the past week. Were there more connections than you expected? Or were there less? Did you have enough close connections, or were they mostly with strangers or acquaintances? Are you just feeling lonely today, or were you lonely for the rest of this past week, too?

Everyone feels lonely sometimes. Loneliness is a normal, natural feeling that we all experience. All people deal with loneliness at some time in their lives. This feeling helps to push us to interact more, to get closer to people, to risk in order to have close relationships. In this way, loneliness can be a good thing. What is your feeling of loneliness pushing you to do?

To deal with loneliness, you need to address what it the feeling pushes you to do.


Do you need to join a group or a club to deal with loneliness? Do you need to deal with loneliness by phoning a friend you haven’t spoken with in a long time?

To deal with loneliness by increasing connections with people, you may need to seek out company and communication. Think about people you could call to talk to, or people you could go see face to face. If no one comes to mind, consider places where you could meet new people. Support groups are a great way to meet and connect with others…and so are clubs, or classes…think of all the places you could spend time with people. Relationships do not always have to be face-to-face to be satisfying. Internet support groups can be very helpful, and you can access them right from your home.

Think of one thing you can do, within the next 24 hours, to deal with loneliness and help you feel more connected with people. What is your loneliness pushing you to do? Choose one action you can take to deal with loneliness, and make a plan to do this action within the next 24 hours.


(Pause)

Now let’s deal with loneliness from another perspective. Regardless of how much contact and connection you have with others, it is essential to be content with your own company. How do you feel when you are alone? Do you find yourself to be good company?

If you are not feeling content with your own company right now, this may translate into a feeling of loneliness. Concentrate on the loneliness, on the aching, empty feeling inside…and now imagine that feeling shifting, just slightly…

Imagine a feeling of peace…contentment…happiness…

Picture this feeling, as if it is a warm liquid. Imagine that the liquid can fill your body, pouring in through the top of your head…so warm and pleasant.


Imagine this liquid filling your body…being poured down, filling up your feet…then your legs….rising higher…to your knees….to your hips…

Feel the warmth filling the core of your body…up to your stomach….chest….all the way to your shoulders…pouring down to your hands and filling your arms…up to your elbows….to your upper arms….

Feel the warmth filling your neck and your head…filling your whole body with a feeling of warmth and peace.


Feel an even greater warmth beginning at the center of your stomach and radiating outward…as if the sun is shining inside you.

Let this feeling of warmth and peace grow…experiencing a feeling of happiness inside.

Feel the warmth growing…growing…until joy is radiating from you, as if your whole body is shining, glowing…radiating joy and happiness.

Inside you feel full, solid…filled with contentment. Imagine any remaining feelings of emptiness being crowded out completely by the warmth inside you.


When you are so content, there is no room for emptiness.

Allow yourself to feel peaceful and serene, even for just a few moments. Right now, everything is as it should be. You are perfectly okay, just as you are. You feel joyful…loved…surrounded by warmth…

You are worth all of the positive things that come your way. You have alot to offer in relationships with others. Feel the happiness radiating from you, and imagine this joy shining forth, like the sun shining down on everyone around you. Feel a sense of connection with the world around you…you are a part of this world…part of the fabric of your community.

The connections you have can expand and grow…allowing you to become even more connected with people.


You are filled with confidence…contentment…secure and confident with a strong sense of self…

All alone, you can be happy and content without feeling lonely, because nothing is missing when you are by yourself. You are perfectly alright by yourself. You do not need anyone else to be whole. Other people can enrich your life, but you are whole all on your own. Experience a feeling of wholeness…completeness…right now. Experience this feeling fully…peaceful…whole…content…complete…happy…

(Pause)

Any time you begin to feel lonely in the future, you can deal with loneliness by experiencing these feelings of contentment again. You can also take action to spend time with others, so that you can be connected with people and not feel lonely.

It’s time to conclude this relaxation exercise. Keep with you the feelings of contentment and peace, as you reawaken your mind and body.


Gradually return to full alertness…stretch your muscles, feeling your body waking up.

Take a deep, cleansing breath in…and as you breathe out, become more awake and alert.

Sit quietly for a few moments with your eyes open, reorienting yourself to your surroundings. When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to the hours ahead, feeling confident and content."
I deal with grief,"Begin by finding a relaxed position, sitting or lying down. Set aside a few minutes to relax.

But first, I would like to talk a bit about the different types of losses.



Grief can result from a variety of types of losses. Some kinds of losses are well-recognized, for example, death of a loved one, divorce, or loss of a job. Other types of losses can be just as difficult to deal with but may be less well understood. Losses may include loss of a pet, relocation, changing jobs, infertility, illness, or any other event that changes life plan
Loss can be experienced with both negative and positive events. An event may be positive overall (for example, getting promotion at work that you were hoping for), but still be associated with loss. Loss of what is familiar, loss of the old way of living…any sort of change can be associated with feelings of loss.

Perhaps you are dealing with a change that is reasonably positive, and your grief is relatively simple to deal with. Maybe you are coping with a significant loss, and are going through a challenging grief process. Or maybe you have experienced a huge loss that has profoundly changed your life, and are having difficulty dealing with grief.


Whatever your situation, your grief is real, and your loss is important.

Though you need time in solitude to come to terms with the loss you have experienced, it is also important to accept support from others. Reach out to someone who can offer you support. You might want to call a friend, even if you haven’t spoken in a while. It’s okay to ask for what you need. Often people do not know how to support you, and they feel relieved if you ask for something specific. Ask for help! Even if it is just calling a friend and asking to eat a meal together…any small act of support can help you to feel less alone. You may also find it therapeutic to journal your grief.

Before thinking about your loss and beginning the process of dealing with grief, let’s start by relaxing. Close your eyes, and just sit or lie quietly. You do not need to do anything in particular.



Take a deep breath, and as you breathe out, feel your body sinking into the surface you are on.

Breathe slowly in…and out…

In…and out…

Keep breathing slowly and calmly, letting your breathing relax you.

Imagine that your body is a fleece blanket. Imagine that the blanket is dipped into warm water. Imagine how it would feel to be floating, suspended in the warm water…gentle waves moving your body…

Now picture being lifted out of the water…the heaviness of the water stretching the blanket…stretching your body…so you are very tall.


Imagine that the blanket is placed on a warm concrete surface in the sun. Imagine how it would feel to be this blanket…so warm and heavy…completely limp…

Steam rises from your body, warmed from beneath by the warm concrete, and warmed from above by the sun. Imagine how it would feel to be this damp blanket, and have the water slowly evaporating…becoming lighter and lighter…steam rising…carrying the water away….

Feel your whole body becoming lighter…relaxed…totally limp…

Let your body become completely relaxed…so calm…so serene…

Now that you are starting to feel more relaxed, let’s focus on dealing with grief.

Dealing with grief is very tiring. You may have been feeling tired, stressed, and burned out lately…and this may be caused by the grief process. It is normal to be short-tempered and have problems with memory and concentration.


These symptoms of dealing with grief can be troubling, but they are normal…and they will go away. You will gradually get back to feeling like yourself. Right now you are healing.

The process of dealing with grief is similar to the process of recovering from a physical injury. When a physical injury occurs, the body needs time to heal and recover. Dealing with grief is no different. The mind needs time to recover and heal. You need the time to cope, and deal with grief. Be kind to yourself, and give yourself this needed time.

Sometimes people who are dealing with grief feel like they are going crazy. You are not going crazy. What you are going through is normal and natural.


There are several stages of grief, and it is normal to experience these stages…many of them more than once…in no particular order.

It is normal to experience numbness, a time where you do not feel very much at all. This does not mean that you are insensitive or that you do not care, rather, it is the mind’s way of protecting you and a normal way of processing a traumatic experience such as a loss. Numbness and shock are a normal reaction to loss.

Another stage you may experience is anger. You may find that you are angry, frustrated, upset…it is okay to be angry when you lose something that is important to you…angry toward the person or thing you lost, angry at the world, at God, at the causes of your loss…you may even feel angry toward others who have not been through what you have. Not all of the anger is rational, and that is because you are grieving. People who are dealing with grief do not always think rationally. Your thinking will become more clear as you cope with grief. The passage of time will help to decrease the irrational thoughts and the extreme anger.


You will probably go through a stage of questioning, wondering why…trying to get answers. It can be hard to understand why losses happen. As part of the process of dealing with grief, you may seek answers as to why the loss happened, and try to make sense of what has occurred. You may find yourself bargaining, trying to make deals with others, with yourself, or with God, to try to make things go back to the way they were before the loss happened. Questioning and bargaining are normal parts of dealing with grief.

Another stage in dealing with grief is a stage of loneliness and sadness. This is a time of low energy, feeling slowed down, sad…maybe even depressed. During this time it is hard to focus and concentrate. You experience memory problems…sometimes feel confused…distracted…have difficulty sleeping…like you are not yourself. It’s normal to feel this way because you are grieving. It is okay to feel sad and upset when you experience loss. These feelings can be very intense and painful. While you are getting through this pain, remember that it will gradually decrease as you heal. Even though it may feel like the sadness will go on and on, you will not feel this way forever.

Acceptance is another stage of grief. During this stage you begin to re-create a new life in the aftermath of the loss. You begin to accept that things have changed. Your life is different…maybe not better…maybe not worse…just different. Acceptance is the act of coming to the realization that the loss has occurred, but you can move on.


It is normal to proceed through the stages of grief in a non-linear order. For example, you may experience acceptance, and then return again to anger. It’s okay to be wherever you are at. It is okay to ask questions and to feel upset. You have the right to grieve.

You can get through this.

You will feel better, and you will make a new life. Your new life may be different than the life you had planned, but you cannot always plan for losses.

It’s okay to experience a variety of emotions. It is okay to be angry. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to feel relief…and you still do care even if you feel relieved in some ways. It is okay to feel guilty. It is okay to feel impatient, to get upset at things that seem small and insignificant. You’re going through a hard time, and a confusing mix of feelings is completely normal. This is the human experience of grief.


You are coping…you are dealing with grief…and you will come out the other side stronger.

You did not deserve this loss. It is not your fault. You are dealing with a situation that is challenging…difficult…perhaps devastating…and you cannot be expected to be over this immediately.

There may not be any reason why things happened this way. Many of the things that happen in life do not make sense. You can grow and become stronger as a result of these challenges, even though there is no good explanation as to why you had to go through such difficult times.

Even after you have dealt with the grief, you will have times where you feel like you are right back where you started. This is normal.

×

Everyone has their own way of going through the process of dealing with grief. You do not need to grieve in a particular way. Do whatever is right for you. You can cry…or not. Be more busy…or less busy. Grieve in your own way.

Though you need time in solitude to come to terms with the loss you have experienced, it is also important to accept support from others. Reach out to someone who can offer you support. You might want to call a friend, even if you haven’t spoken in a while. It’s okay to ask for what you need. Often people do not know how to support you, and they feel relieved if you ask for something specific. Ask for help! Even if it is just calling a friend and asking to eat a meal together…any small act of support can help you to feel less alone.

You may even want to seek out others who are dealing with grief, to find support from people who can relate to what you are going through. You can find support groups in the community or on the internet.



Allow yourself the time you need to grieve.

Take good care of yourself. Eat well. Get exercise. Try to keep a regular sleep-wake schedule. You need the strength.

Now if you want to, you can take a moment just to be with the feelings you have…just to allow the grief, face the emotions, and accept that you are grieving. I’ll pause for one minute, and during this time you may choose to just relax and breathe deeply, or you might decide to just go with the emotions you have, and experience the grief.

Do whatever feels right for you right now. If you need more time, go ahead and pause this audio, and resume whenever you are ready.



Let’s conclude this exercise with some relaxation, to allow you to get a break from the grief you are going through.

Focus on your breathing for a few moments…breathing slowly in…and out…

In…and out…

Slowly breathing…relaxing…

Create a picture in your mind, imagining a peaceful place where you have no worries. You may picture a comfortable room…quiet…peaceful…

Imagine that the room is warm…and has a comfortable place to sit or lie down where you can relax. Imagine sitting or lying down…maybe on a pile of soft pillows…releasing all your worries with a sigh.



In this room, you have no cares…no worries…no problems…nothing to worry about or think about at all.

This is a place where you can completely relax…you can take a break here…even just for a few moments…to get away from all of the stress and tension.

Picture this room in your mind. What does the room look like? Create a detailed image of this room in your mind…so comfortable…complete serenity…



You can return to this room in your imagination when you need a break…whenever you need to relax.

Whenever things get difficult and you just need a rest, you can picture this room in your mind.

Now it’s time to conclude this relaxation exercise.

You may want to re-awaken or drift off to sleep. I’ll count now from five to one. If you decide to wake up, let yourself become more and more awake with each number, until at one you are fully awake and alert. If you decide to sleep, become sleepier with each number, until at one you are deeply asleep.
